# Dumping-Google-Chrome-Passwords
This script is for dumping saved passwords in google's chrome web browser. Whenever a user checks the remember me box in the Chrome, their login data is saved to the sqlite database file located at C:\\Program Files\stored at \Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data .
As this database file only requires current user's access right for accessing it, it becomes quite easy for the attacker to dump the passwords if he/she can trick the victim to execute this script.

I have coded this while pursuing the course **Python for Offensive Pentest**. Special thanks to Sir Hussam Khrais.
